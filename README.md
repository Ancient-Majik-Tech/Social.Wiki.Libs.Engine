### Welcome

Welcome to Realms Engine, our custom application engine. While most engines are designed to be used only for game engines. We are building our engine to provide a dynamic way of handling both tool applications or game applications using the same basic core features built ontop of [Realms Core][Page Libs.Core] library and wrapped around Open GL, and SDL2. With long term goals of supporting Open AL to have sound handleable in 3D space.

Please note that Realms Engine is very early in development but soon will explode in development as we bring [Realms Core][Page Libs.Core] into a working state as it was originally developed as part of prototypes. Hoevever we rebuilt the underingling prototypes into the Realms Core Project.
